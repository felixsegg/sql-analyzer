<b>Generated Query Details Help</b><br><br>
This window shows a single SQL statement that was <i>automatically</i> generated by an LLM from a specific prompt. These entries are later used in the evaluation and CSV export.
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Prompt:</b><br>
        The prompt this query was generated from (belongs to a sample query and a prompt type).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>LLM:</b><br>
        The language model that produced this SQL.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>SQL:</b><br>
        The generated SQL statement.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Origin &amp; repetitions:</b><br>
        Multiple generated queries may exist for the same Promptâ€“LLM pair (e.g., due to repetitions and the temperature range used to avoid cached responses).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Workflow:</b><br>
        Generated queries are evaluated against their sample query in the Evaluation window; results can be exported as CSV for further analysis (e.g., in R).
    </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Generated queries are intended to be system-created and kept unchanged. Manual editing is not recommended; if you modify a query, re-run the evaluation to keep results consistent. You can delete a generated query if you want to exclude it from evaluation.</p>
